sourch code and resources for our final computer science assignment.

We decided to make a web-based version of the game Hangman, but focused
on teaching begginer programming concepts to new students.

The game is simple. The computer will choose a random word, and you are supposed to guess what it is by doing the following:
1. Choose a letter
	If the secret word contains the letter that you guessed, it will show up on the screen!
2. Deduct what the word is
	The word that is generated is based on what difficulty setting you choose -- harder difficulty, more obscure/long words
3. Save the hangman!
	Correctly guess the word before the hangman is hung, or else you lose!
